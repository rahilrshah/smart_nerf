# requirements_unified.txt
#
# Unified requirements file for the Intelligent 3D Capture project.
# This combines dependencies for Instant-NGP, Nerfstudio, and custom scripts
# into a single environment.
#
# --- IMPORTANT INSTALLATION NOTES ---
# 1. Install PyTorch with CUDA support FIRST:
#    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
#
# 2. Install Nerfstudio SECOND (it will handle many ML dependencies):
#    pip install nerfstudio
#
# 3. Then install the remaining requirements from this file:
#    pip install -r requirements_unified.txt
