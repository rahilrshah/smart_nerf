# requirements.txt
#
# This file lists the Python dependencies for the Intelligent 3D Capture project.
# It combines requirements from Instant-NGP, Neuralangelo, and our custom scripts.
#
# --- IMPORTANT INSTALLATION NOTE ---
# For CUDA compatibility, it is STRONGLY recommended to install PyTorch separately
# BEFORE installing the rest of these requirements. See the project README for instructions.


# --- Core ML & Numeric Libraries ---
# Used by virtually all components.
numpy
scipy

# --- From Instant-NGP (vendor/instant-ngp/requirements.txt) ---
# Dependencies for the pyngp bindings and the interactive testbed.
requests
dearpygui   # For the Instant-NGP interactive GUI viewer
commentjson

# --- From Neuralangelo (vendor/neuralangelo/requirements.txt) ---
# A comprehensive list for the SOTA meshing pipeline.
ninja           # High-performance build system, used for custom CUDA extensions
pyyaml          # For parsing .yaml configuration files
einops          # For flexible tensor operations
scikit-image
h5py
gdown           # For downloading pre-trained models or data from Google Drive
tensorboard     # For logging training progress with Neuralangelo

# --- Image and Video I/O ---
# Used by Neuralangelo and our custom scripts (src/4_... and src/2_...).
imageio
imageio-ffmpeg
opencv-python   # For image processing, specifically Laplacian variance in analyze_weakness.py

# --- Visualization & Plotting (Our Custom Scripts) ---
# Used by src/2_analyze_weakness.py to generate the uncertainty heatmap.
matplotlib

# --- General Utilities ---
# Widely used for progress bars.
